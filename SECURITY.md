# Security

Data Explorer runs on your own computer and is meant to be reached from it only: Docker publishes it on `127.0.0.1`, and the API refuses requests from other sites (Host, `Sec-Fetch-Site` and `Origin` checks) and network paths.

- **Your data** stays on your computer. Only the optional assistant sends anything out: your messages, column names and types, and analysis results — never whole rows — to the AI provider you configure.
- **API keys** are read from the environment or saved by the app outside the repository; the API never returns them.

To report a vulnerability, please open a [private security advisory](https://github.com/CyrilKFOURI/data-explorer/security/advisories/new) rather than a public issue.
